ZGTracker
=========
**ZGTracker** is a "World of Warcraft Addon" to tracks Zul'Gurub coins and bijous lootage.

The Addon also provides Roll-Automation. 

You will also be able to auto Need/Greed/Pass on bijous and coins.

> **NOTE:**
>
> - The Addon is developed for WoW 1.12.1 (toc 11200), also known as Vanilla WoW 


Usage
-----
Using ZGTracker should be very simple. The Addon comes with 5 icons on top.

Click the **?**</i> `About` button and you will get a nice window with all the explanations you need.

For a better experience I recommend to `Reset` Loot-Data before starting the raid.

This way you won't have leftover data from previous runs.

The addon, tho, has a nice features that will ask you to reset your Loot-Data upon the first Bijou/Coin lootage.

ZGTracker provides also some slash commands:

| Command     | Parameters                     | Output                                 |
